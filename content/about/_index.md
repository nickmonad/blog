Hey, I'm Nick! I'm a software engineer interested in deployment infrastructure, systems programming,
observability, performance analysis, and advanced testing methods.

Currently, I work on infrastructure and backend systems at [Vertex Software](https://vertex3d.com/). In the past, I've
worked on media streaming at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com), backend services at [Foundation Devices](https://foundationdevices.com),
observability at [Chainlink Labs](https://chain.link), and various product and infrastructure initiatives elsewhere.

There's something absolutely magical about software. It's hard for me to remember a time when I didn't love it. Even
when it's been challenging I just haven't been able to put it down. Over the years I've come to value simplicity,
delivering for the right scale at the right time, and persistence in continual learning.
I hope this blog helps to inspire and share knowledge with others on their journey as well.

Outside of programming, I love spending time with my wife, playing competitive disc golf, and living my Catholic faith.
