Hey, I'm Nick. Welcome to my little corner of the web. I'm a software engineer interested in
web application development, infrastructure automation, performance, and observability.

I'm the founding engineer of [signup.casa](https://signup.casa). In the past, I've worked on media streaming at
[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com), backend services at [Foundation Devices](https://foundationdevices.com),
observability at [Chainlink Labs](https://chain.link), and various product and infrastructure projects elsewhere.

Outside of programming, I enjoy disc golf and reading about philosophy & Catholicism.
