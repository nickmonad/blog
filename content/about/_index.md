Hey, I'm Nick. I'm a software engineer interested in web application development, infrastructure automation,
performance, and observability.

I'm the founding engineer of [signup.casa](https://signup.casa). In the past, I've worked on media streaming at
[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com), backend services at [Foundation Devices](https://foundationdevices.com),
observability at [Chainlink Labs](https://chain.link), and various product and infrastructure projects elsewhere.

Outside of programming, I enjoy disc golf and reading about philosophy & Catholicism.

If you find an error in one of my posts, please email me at <code>nickmonad<span>@</span>pm.me</code>.

I am available for contracting and consulting as well. I prefer to work with small to medium sized businesses who need
help with their software stack, or are looking to build a custom solution. If you are a software company, I can help
determine how to architect your deployment infrastructure and build it out. Let's chat!
