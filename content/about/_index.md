Hey, I'm Nick! Welcome to my little corner of the web. I'm a software engineer interested in
deployment infrastructure, systems programming, observability, performance analysis, and web
application development.

Currently, I'm working on [signup.casa](https://signup.casa) as the founding engineer. In the past, I've worked on media streaming at
[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com), backend services at [Foundation Devices](https://foundationdevices.com),
observability at [Chainlink Labs](https://chain.link), and various product and infrastructure initiatives elsewhere.

There's something absolutely magical about software. It's hard for me to remember a time when I didn't love it. Even
when it's been challenging I just haven't been able to put it down. Over the years I've really come to value two key factors:
simplicity and persistence. I hope this blog can help others on their journey as well.

Outside of programming, I love spending time with my wife, playing competitive disc golf, reading philosophy, and
living my Catholic faith.
