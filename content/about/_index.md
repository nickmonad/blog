Hey, I'm Nick. I'm a software engineer interested in all things bitcoin, infrastructure, and Rust.

Currently, I work at [Foundation Devices](https://foundationdevices.com), primarily on backend
services and infrastructure related tasks.

Previously, I've worked on observability and monitoring at [Chainlink Labs](https://chain.link), media
streaming at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com), and various product and infrastructure roles elsewhere.

Outside of programming, I enjoy disc golf and reading about philosophy / Catholicism.
