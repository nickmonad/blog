### what I'm doing now

Updated March 3, 2023

* Living in Iowa. It's good to be near family.
* Working at [Foundation Devices](https://foundationdevices.com). Coming up on my 1 year anniversary.
* Preparing to get married (!) to my dear love - Leah - in May. I am beyond grateful.
* Getting out to play disc golf more as the weather improves. I won't be able to play
nearly as many tournaments as I have the past couple of years, but I hope to get a few good ones in.
* Figuring out how to write a [nostr](https://nostr.how/) client in Rust.
* Thinking a lot about how to simplify infrastructure management, particularly around secret deployment
and orchestration with [nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/). Why do we make things so damn complex?

Thanks [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about) for the inspiration.
