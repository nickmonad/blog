I did the thing.

As they say, the 3rd (or maybe 10th) time is the charm. And just after I turned 30 too.

Keep an eye out for some upcoming posts. I'm currently setting up NixOS on my homelab server, so that should be a
fun one to write about.

```rust
fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    println!("initial commit!");
    Ok(())
}
```
